# Smart Office Pro

> A responsive Office Application project with Vue.js and Material Design. I am not an UI/UX expert but I tried to make an interface easy to understand and make it visually simple.

After experimenting with Vue and Vuex for a while I realized that it would be much simpler to do responsive application with Material Design. For this application I used vuematerial library in order to make it fully responsive. You should be able to use it on your phone and on your desktop, or on a tablet.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
